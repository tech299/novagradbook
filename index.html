        <h2>About the Book</h2>
        <p>
            In <em>The Eyes of Novograd</em>, Ivan Sokolov masterfully unravels a story of espionage, secrets, and paranoia during the height of the Cold War. 
            Set in the neutral city of Novograd, the novel follows customs officer Anatoly Ivanovich as he becomes tangled in a web of surveillance, deceit, and hidden motives. 
            Through subtle tension and rich character development, Sokolov captures the quiet yet dangerous undercurrents of a city caught between two superpowers. 
            The book takes readers on a journey where trust is scarce, and nothing is quite as it seems.

        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <p>
            Ivan Sokolov, a Soviet-born writer and former journalist, lived through the Cold War and used his experiences to shape much of his fiction. 
            Known for his focus on moral ambiguity and complex characters, Sokolov’s works have long been regarded as some of the most compelling yet elusive tales of the era. 
            <em>The Eyes of Novograd</em> stands as one of his most intriguing and controversial works, with rumors suggesting it was pulled from circulation due to its unsettling parallels to real-world events. 
            Despite this, Sokolov’s influence on Cold War literature remains undeniable.

        <h2>How to Get the Book</h2>
        <p><strong>Can you get it?</strong></p>
        <p>The short answer: <strong>No.</strong></p>
        <p>
            Due to its striking similarity to certain real-world events, <em>The Eyes of Novograd</em> has never been made widely available. The book exists only in limited print, 
            and attempts to digitize or republish it have been consistently blocked. Some say the novel hits too close to the truth, while others believe it has simply slipped through the cracks of history. 
            Those who possess original copies guard them closely, and only a few scholars have been granted access to the text.
        </p>
        <p>At present, there are no official copies available for sale or distribution.</p>

                <em>The Eyes of Novograd</em> is believed to have been suppressed due to its striking resemblance to real-world Cold War espionage events. Some believe that government agencies took an interest in keeping the book from wide circulation, while others 
                think it was merely a victim of poor distribution at the time. Either way, the mystery surrounding the novel has only added to its legend.

                Information on Sokolov is scarce. What is known about him comes from sparse interviews and his own writings. He preferred to stay out of the public eye, choosing instead to let his stories speak for themselves. There are a few biographies in the works, 
                but they are based largely on speculation and the few personal documents that remain.
